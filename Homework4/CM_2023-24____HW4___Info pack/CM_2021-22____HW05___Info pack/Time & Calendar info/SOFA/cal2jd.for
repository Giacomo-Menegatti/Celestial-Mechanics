*  Gregorian Calendar to Julian Date.
*
*  This routine is part of the International Astronomical Union's
*  SOFA (Standards of Fundamental Astronomy) software collection.
*
*  Status:  support routine.
*
*  Given:
*     IY,IM,ID    i     year, month, day in Gregorian calendar (Note 1)
*
*  Returned:
*     DJM0        d     MJD zero-point: always 2400000.5
*     DJM         d     Modified Julian Date for 0 hrs
*     J           i     status:
*                           0 = OK
*                          -1 = bad year   (Note 3: JD not computed)
*                          -2 = bad month  (JD not computed)
*                          -3 = bad day    (JD computed)
*
*  Notes:
*
*  1) The algorithm used is valid from -4800 March 1, but this
*     implementation rejects dates before -4799 January 1.
*
*  2) The Julian Date is returned in two pieces, in the usual SOFA
*     manner, which is designed to preserve time resolution.  The
*     Julian Date is available as a single number by adding DJM0 and
*     DJM.
*
*  3) In early eras the conversion is from the "Proleptic Gregorian
*     Calendar";  no account is taken of the date(s) of adoption of
*     the Gregorian Calendar, nor is the AD/BC numbering convention
*     observed.
